## Terms & Conditions

- This Licium demo is for **testing purposes only** and pre-alpha!   
- By using the Licium demo you accept the following terms and conditions. 

### ISCC Codes

- With the Licium demo you can generate [ISCC codes](https://iscc.codes) from the uploaded digital media assets.
- Please be aware, that the ISCC system will get a major update in September 2021, so the ISCC codes that you currently generate and register are not structurally compatible with the future ISCCs.

### Granted Rights and Licenses

- The ISCC codes will be generated by uploading the digital media assets to the servers of the ISCC Foundation [iscc.foundation](https://iscc.foundation). After creation of the ISCC codes, the uploaded digital media assets will be deleted from the servers. No digital media assets will be permanently stored on any of the servers.   
- In the further process, the Licium demo only makes use of the thumbnails of the digital media assets, as it does not have access to the original digital media assets any longer. 
- **Please be aware that the thumbnails generated from the digital media assets (*not* the uploaded digital media assets themselves) will be uploaded and permanently STORED on IPFS!**
